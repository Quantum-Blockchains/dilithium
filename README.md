# CRYSTALS-Dilithium

Pure RUST implementation of [CRYSTALS-Dilithium](https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/) digital signature scheme in 3 variants:
- dilithium2 
- dilithium3 
- dilithuim5.

The code was ported from the original reference [source code](https://github.com/pq-crystals/dilithium) provided by the authors of the algorithm. 

The implementation takes advantage of RUST  clean and safe memory management. The code is much cleaner and shorter compared to the original.
The implementation was verified in two separate ways:
- Cross-verification with the reference implementation, where signatures generated by the RUST implementation were successfully verified by the reference C-implementation, and signatures generated by the reference implementation were verified by the RUST implementation.
- Self-verification, where signatures generated by the RUST implementation were verified by the RUST implementation itself. The verification was performed using the Monte Carlo methodology for random keys and random messages.
